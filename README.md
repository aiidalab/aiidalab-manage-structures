# mc-structure
## Uploading a new structure
File formats compatible with [ASE](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/) can be used.
In the example a .mol file for a structure is generated with ChemDraw. 

The structure is uploaded, a warning message is provided if similar structures were already computed.

The structure is stored in the database.

The structure created with ChemDraw is properly scaled to conventional C-C sp2 bond lengths.

A unit cell is created identifying two equivalent atoms in the edited (scaled) structure.
